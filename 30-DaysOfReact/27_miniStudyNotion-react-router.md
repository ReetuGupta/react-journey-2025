# 🧭 Day 27 – React Router Project | Mini StudyNotion

## 📝 Overview
Today, I built a **mini authentication app** inspired by **StudyNotion** using **React Router v6**.  
This project helped me understand how routing works in React — handling multiple pages, protected routes, and authentication flow with reusable components.

## 📚 What I Built

### 🔐 Authentication Flow
- Signup with role selection (**Student / Instructor**)
- Login and Logout functionality
- Protected route for Dashboard – accessible only when logged in

### 🧭 Navigation with React Router v6
- Implemented routes for **Home**, **Login**, **Signup**, and **Dashboard**
- Used `<Navigate />` for redirecting unauthorized users

### 🧱 Reusable Components
- `LoginForm` and `SignupForm` with validation and password toggle  
- `Navbar` with conditional rendering (login/signup vs dashboard/logout)  
- `Template` component for consistent layout  

### 🎨 UI & UX Enhancements
- Responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**  
- Added **react-hot-toast** for login/signup notifications  
- Clean visuals with modern layout and SVG assets  

## ✨ Key Learnings
- Deep understanding of **React Router v6** concepts  
- Building and protecting routes dynamically  
- Managing **authentication state** using props  
- Enhancing reusability with modular component structure

It gave me the confidence to structure real-world React apps with navigation and authentication flow.
