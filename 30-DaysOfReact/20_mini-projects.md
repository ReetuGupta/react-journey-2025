# Day 20 â€“ Building Mini Projects: Counter App & Toggle Button

## Overview
Today I built two small React projects to practice state management using `useState` and component rendering. The focus was on functionality and interactivity rather than complex UI. These mini projects helped reinforce the core concepts of state updates, event handling, and conditional rendering.

## ðŸ“š What I Built

### 1. Counter App
- Displays a counter value.
- Increment and decrement functionality using `useState`.
- Reset button to bring the counter back to its initial value.
- Optional logic to prevent the counter from going below zero.

### 2. Toggle Button
- Button toggles between ON and OFF states.
- Demonstrates conditional rendering and updating styles dynamically.

### âœ¨ Key Learnings
- How to use the useState hook to manage and update UI state.
- Handling events and passing callbacks between components.
- Conditional rendering to change styles and content based on state.
- How Tailwind transitions can enhance user experience.

## ðŸ§  Summary

Even small projects provide deep learning opportunities. The emphasis was on functionality first, UI improvements later. Itâ€™s a reminder that **consistency is more important than perfection** when learning React.

***These mini projects helped me practice core React concepts and build confidence by coding regularly!***
