# Day 21 – Building a Tour & Travels Website: Incredible Journeys

## Overview
Today, I built a React project called **Incredible Journeys**, a travel-themed website that showcases different tour packages for famous destinations in India. The focus was on learning how to manage lists and dynamically update the UI based on user actions.

## 📚 What I Built

### Tour Packages Display
- Showcased multiple travel destinations with details.
- Each package is rendered dynamically using React components and props.

### Not Interested Button
- Clicking this button removes the selected tour card from the UI.
- Practiced list rendering and item removal using `useState`.

### Refresh Window
- When all tours are removed, a “No Tours Left” message is shown.
- A refresh button reloads all tour packages back into the UI.

### ✨ Key Learnings
- Mastered using useState to manage lists and update UI dynamically.
- Improved understanding of props and component structure.
- Practiced conditional rendering to handle scenarios like empty states.
- Designed a clean, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS.

## 🧠 Summary
This project helped me understand how state-driven UI changes work in real-world scenarios. Handling list updates, removing items, and managing empty states strengthened my core React skills.
