# Day 22 â€“ Exploring React Concepts for the Upcoming Project

## Overview
Today, I focused on learning and practicing new React concepts that Iâ€™ll be applying in my next project. The main goal was to understand how these features work so I can implement them effectively when building.

## ðŸ“š What I Explored

### useEffect Hook
- Managing side effects in React components.
- Handling initial render and updates based on dependencies.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component mounted or updated!");
}, [dependency]);
```

### React Toastify
-Adding notification toasts for better user feedback.
-Provides simple, customizable alerts without writing extra UI logic.

```jsx
import { toast } from 'react-toastify';
toast.success("Action completed!");
```

### React Icons
-Enhancing UI with scalable vector icons.
- Easy integration for adding visual appeal.

```jsx
import { FaBeer } from 'react-icons/fa';
<FaBeer />
```

### âœ¨ Key Learnings
- Learned when and how to use useEffect efficiently to manage side effects.
- Understood the importance of notifications in improving user experience.
- Realized how small design elements like icons make the UI more engaging and interactive.

## ðŸ§  Summary
Today was dedicated to strengthening my understanding of React concepts. I plan to apply these learnings in my upcoming projects to build more dynamic and user-friendly applications.
