# Day 24 â€“ React Forms: Handling Inputs, Checkboxes, Radios & Select Menus

## Overview
Today, I learned how to work with **React Forms** by practicing different input types like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, textareas, and select menus. I explored how to manage form data using the `useState` hook with a single state object and how to update it dynamically based on user interaction.

## ðŸ“š What I Practiced

### Managing Multiple Inputs
- Used `useState` with an object to handle multiple form fields together.
- Updated the form state based on input changes using a single `handleChange` function.

```jsx
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  firstName: "",
  lastName: "",
  email: "",
  comments: "",
  isValue: true,
  mode: "",
  favCar: "",
});

const handleChange = (event) => {
  setFormData((prevFormData) => {
    const { name, value, checked, type } = event.target;
    return {
      ...prevFormData,
      [name]: type === "checkbox" ? checked : value,
    };
  });
};
```

### Handling Different Input Types
- Text inputs for first name, last name, and email.
- Textarea for comments.
- Checkbox to toggle values.
- Radio buttons for selecting modes.
- Select dropdown for choosing favorite cars.

### Form Submission
- Used handleSubmit to prevent the default form submission behavior.
- Logged the form data when the form is submitted.

```jsx
function handleSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log("Form submitted:", formData);
}
```

### âœ¨ Key Learnings
- Managing form data using useState and an object structure.
- Handling various input types with a single event handler.
- Implementing controlled components for better state management.
- Learning how form submission works in React.

## ðŸ§  Summary
Forms are a critical part of any web application. By practicing different input types and managing their state in React, Iâ€™ve strengthened my understanding of how user interactions can be handled cleanly and effectively. This practice will be useful in building robust, interactive forms for real-world applications.
