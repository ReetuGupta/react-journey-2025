# Day 13 & 14 – Harry Potter Series Cards UI

## Overview
For Day 13 & 14 of the 30 Days of React challenge, I built a fun and meaningful mini project inspired by classic movies — the **Harry Potter Series Cards**! It’s a responsive React app that showcases the iconic Harry Potter films using interactive cards. This project was a creative way to practice component structuring, props, styling, and deployment.

## What I Built
- ✅ Responsive and clean card components using **React 19** and **Tailwind CSS**
- ✅ Clickable links to stream the movies directly on **Hotstar**
- ✅ Structured components with props to reuse layouts
- ✅ Deployed using **Vite** and **Netlify**
- ✅ Dark-themed UI with hover animations and modern design

## Features
- Movie cards dynamically rendered from a local JSON file
- Grid layout that adjusts beautifully on different screen sizes
- Interactive UI with hover effects
- Direct links to Hotstar for each movie

## Tech Stack
- **React 19 (Vite)** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsiveness
- Local **JSON file** for managing data
- Deployed on **Netlify**
