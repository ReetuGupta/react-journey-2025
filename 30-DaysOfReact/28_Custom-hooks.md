# 🎲 Day 28 – Random GIF Generator | Custom Hooks in React

## 📝 Overview
Today’s focus was on **Custom Hooks** — one of React’s most powerful concepts.  
I built a **Random GIF Generator** using the **GIPHY API**, which shows both random and tag-based GIFs.  
This helped me write cleaner, reusable code by extracting API logic into a custom hook.

## 📚 What I Built

### 🌀 Two Main Components
- **Random GIF**: Displays a completely random GIF  
- **Tag GIF**: Displays GIFs based on a user-entered keyword  

### ⚙️ Custom Hook (`useGif`)
- Handles API calls, loading state, and data management  
- Reused seamlessly in both **Random** and **Tag** components  

### 🖼 UI Features
- Spinner while loading  
- Responsive, minimal layout using **Tailwind CSS**  
- “Fetch New GIF” button for instant reload  

## ✨ Key Learnings
- How to **create and use custom hooks**  
- Using **Axios** for API calls in React  
- Managing **loading** and **data** state separately  
- Working with **environment variables** in **Vite**

## 🧠 Summary
This project gave me hands-on practice in **code reusability** and **clean component design**.  
Custom hooks simplified complex logic and made the app easier to scale.  
Small project — big learning!
