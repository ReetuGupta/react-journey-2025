# Day 23 – Build a Course Explorer: Top Courses Platform

## Overview
Today, I built a React project called **CourseHub | Explore Our Top Courses**, an interactive platform that displays top courses across different categories like Development, Design, Business, and more. The key highlight was learning how to fetch data from an API and implement category-based filtering with smooth UI interactions.

## 📚 What I Built

### Course Display
- Dynamically fetched courses from the CodeHelp API.
- Displayed course title, description, and image in clean, responsive cards.

### Category Filters
- Added filter buttons (All, Development, Design, Business, Lifestyle, etc.).
- Clicking a filter shows only the courses from that category.

### Like & Enroll Features
- Users can like/unlike a course, with toast notifications.
- Enroll button disables after enrolling and shows a success toast.

### UI & UX Enhancements
- Integrated React Toastify for notifications.
- Added hover effects, gradients, and smooth transitions using Tailwind CSS.
- Designed a responsive layout for both desktop and mobile.

## ✨ Key Learnings
- Learned how to fetch and render data from an API in React.
- Mastered conditional rendering for active filters and button states.
- Managed multiple states like liked courses, enrolled state, and active category.
- Improved UI/UX using Tailwind CSS with gradients, shadows, and animations.

## 🧠 Summary
This project strengthened my skills in using React hooks, managing state, handling API data, and building clean, interactive UIs. It gave me hands-on experience in developing a real-world mini project with dynamic data and user interactions.

***Building projects like this helps me connect theory with practice and make learning more exciting!***
