# React Journey ðŸš€

This repo is all about my **30 Days of React** journey, which Iâ€™ll be documenting here and on LinkedIn.  
Iâ€™ll be sharing day-wise progress as I go deeper into React and its ecosystem.

ðŸ“Œ Youâ€™ll find:
- Structured daily folders with code and notes
- React fundamentals and hands-on practice
- Some JavaScript refreshers along the way
